//! This crate contains numeric constants for ETSI TS 103-636 "DECT-2020 New Radio (NR)".
//!
//! This encompasses bitfield values from the specification itself as well as entries in the
//! extensible [DECT-2020 NR Endpoint Multiplexing Address Allocation] mapping.
//!
//! This crate tries to strike a balance between not being opinionated in terms of types and being
//! practical: It uses newtypes of the minimal suitable bit length to express constants, which
//! provide Debug implementations that may include a lot of code (relying on dead code eliminiation
//! to not weigh down users needlessly).
